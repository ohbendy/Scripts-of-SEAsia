This table of SEAsian scripts is generated from the [source repository](https://github.com/ohbendy/Scripts-of-SEAsia) hosted on GitHub and maintained by Ben Mitchell. Please file bug reports to submit requests for other scripts to be included, or for me to correct errors.

With thanks to Sovichet Tep who have helped get this set up with GitHub Pages. Thanks also to Aditya Bayu (Indonesian scripts), Chow Kensan Tunkhang (Lik scripts), Jad Maza (Philippine scripts) and David Wharton (Lik and Tham scripts).
